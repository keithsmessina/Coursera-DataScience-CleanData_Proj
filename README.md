The script in this repository is used to assemble the data in the "data" folder into tidy data useful for analysis. The script "run_analysis.R" is initiated when loaded up by using the runAnalysis() command to run the function in the script.

When run from the same directory as the data folder, this function loads the data and shapes it into two tidy datasets:
(1) tidyFitData
(2) tidyAveragedData

When the function call is complete, it prints the structure of the two tidy datasets using the str() function so that they are easily assessed.
